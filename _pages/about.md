I'm a Research Associate from the [Johns Hopkins Primary Care Policy Center](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/johns-hopkins-primary-care-policy-center). My research interests lie in **health economics, labor economics, and environmental economics**, with a particular focus on primary health care, health and income inequality, underserved populations, technological innovation, and health technology assessment.

I had the honor of earning a Master of Health Science degree (Global Health Economics Track) from the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/), where I met a mentor who may have changed the course of my life: *Prof. Leiyu Shi*. Prior to that, I received a Bachelor's degree in Economics from Sichuan University.

I have also maintained a long-standing interest in the translation and investment of medical technologies. During my time at Johns Hopkins University, I served as the team leader representing the university in the [2024 China International College Students Innovation Competition](https://cy.ncss.cn/en/)[^1], where our project won a **Global Silver Award**. Previously, I represented Sichuan University and led teams to win **National Gold Awards** in both the 2022 and 2023 editions of the same competition.

As a first-generation college student, I am deeply grateful to my parents, mentors, friends, and alma mater for helping me transition from a small county in Northeast China to world-leading academic institutions.

[^1]:The China International College Students Innovation Competition, organized by the Ministry of Education, with a letter from the General Secretary and attendance from the Vice Premier, is known as the premier competition in Chinese higher education. The event spans over a hundred countries, thousands of universities, and tens millions of participants.
